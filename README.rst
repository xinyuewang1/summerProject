Description of application
============

This is a web-based application that aims to assist users with using Dublin city's Dublin Bus service.
It achieves this by providing information on routes, stops and can provide an estimated travel time for complete or partial sections of a journey.
The app is primarily designed for mobile use based on the assumption that the majority of users will be "on the go".
Users can interact with the app with ease, even if they are either a seasoned Dublin Bus veteran or new to the city or the transport service itself.
